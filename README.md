# Tekla---Align-3D-Model-View-Angle
Rotates user view camera angle to be aligned with nearest axis angle of global coordinate system

:: This is made only for learning purposes of camera view angles and rotations.

# How it does it
* By getting the dispaly camera coordinate system the Z and X angles can be calculated.
* Knowing the camera rotation, view can be rotated to required angle.

## Usage
* Compile.
* Create and assign keyboard shortcut to a macro calling the executable.
